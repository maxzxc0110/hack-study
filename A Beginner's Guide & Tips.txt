Issue 1.Lack of thorough attack process
- Host discovery
- Service discovery
- service version discovery
- Vulerability research
- Linux(port 111)¡¢window(port 445)Enumeration
- Webserver vulnerability scan
- Directory brute force every webserver
- Analyze source code of every web app(look for ips,usernames/passwords,explanations of?)
- Brute force all service

Issue 2. Lack of automation of the process
- Research attacks scripte on the internet to enhance you methodology

Issue 3.Failing to document all steps being performed and their output.

Issue 4.Lack of sleep during the exam

Issue 5.Failing to reboot target machines prior to attack.



Step 1. Ensure that you are comfortable with Linux
--------------------------------------------------
- LinuxSurvival.com (you should be able to comfortably pass all 4 quizzes)
- CompTIA Linux+ (You should be just a hair under a Linux system administrator in skill level, simple shell scripting, and well beyond a Linux user skill level)
 
You should be very comfortable with the material covered in the videos below (Go through all of them twice if you are new to Linux):
